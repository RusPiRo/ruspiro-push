# RusPiRo Push

This `cargo` tool allows to push new RuspiRo kernel images to the Rapsberry Pi assuming the receiving
bare metal kernel [Bootloader](https://www.github.com/RuspiRo/loader) is running there and it is
connected through a serial port to the development machine.

## Install
Use `cargo` to install this subcommand:
```
$> cargo install cargo-ruspiro-push
```

Once done you could call the tool like so:
```
$> cargo ruspiro-publish -k <image_file> -p <serial_port>
```

The target architecture will be derived from the filename. `kernel7.img` will be handled as Aarch32
and `kernel8.img` will handled as Aarch64 target. For any other file name you need to provide the 
desired target architecture of the kernel file to be transfered using the `-a` flag. Use the
`--help` flag to see all available options for this command:
```
$> cargo ruspiro-push --help
Push a kernel image to Raspberry Pi 0.1.0
